{a:"Pink Floyd",t:"The Dark Side of the Moon",y:1973,g:"Progressive Rock",d:"Released in March 1973, this concept album explores themes of conflict, greed, time, death, and mental illness — partly inspired by founding member Syd Barrett's declining mental health. The album was recorded at Abbey Road Studios over nearly a year, with engineer Alan Parsons pioneering techniques like multitrack looping and elaborate sound effects. It spent an unprecedented 937 weeks on the Billboard 200 chart and has sold over 45 million copies worldwide. The iconic prism artwork by Storm Thorgerson for Hipgnosis became one of the most recognizable album covers in history. Every track flows seamlessly into the next, creating a continuous 43-minute experience that rewards headphone listening like almost nothing else in the rock canon.",tr:["Speak to Me","Breathe","On the Run","Time","The Great Gig in the Sky","Money","Us and Them","Any Colour You Like","Brain Damage","Eclipse"],s:[3,4,5,6]},
{a:"Radiohead",t:"OK Computer",y:1997,g:"Alternative Rock",d:"Recorded primarily at actress Jane Seymour's 15th-century mansion in Bath, England and produced by Nigel Godrich, this album emerged from a band exhausted by touring The Bends. Thom Yorke channeled his anxieties about modern life into lyrics about motorways, aircrashes, and hollow politicians — eerily predicting the digital alienation of the smartphone era before it arrived. The album debuted at number one in the UK and has since been voted the greatest album of all time in multiple polls. Its blend of progressive structures with alternative rock accessibility created a template that bands have been trying to replicate for three decades. The closing track 'The Tourist' was written by guitarist Jonny Greenwood as a plea for everyone to slow down.",tr:["Airbag","Paranoid Android","Subterranean Homesick Alien","Exit Music (For a Film)","Let Down","Karma Police","Fitter Happier","Electioneering","Climbing Up the Walls","No Surprises","Lucky","The Tourist"],s:[1,3,4,5]},
{a:"Miles Davis",t:"Kind of Blue",y:1959,g:"Jazz",d:"Recorded across just two sessions at Columbia's 30th Street Studio in New York in March and April 1959, with a sextet including John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Bill Evans, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb. Davis gave his musicians modal sketches rather than complex chord changes, encouraging spontaneous melodic invention. The result is the best-selling jazz album in history with over 5 million copies sold in the US alone. Pianist Bill Evans' liner notes compared the approach to Japanese visual art — each performance a unique, unrepeatable brushstroke. The original master tape ran slightly fast due to a mechanical error, meaning every version heard for decades was in the wrong key — only corrected in a 1997 remaster.",tr:["So What","Freddie Freeloader","Blue in Green","All Blues","Flamenco Sketches"],s:[0,2,3]},
{a:"Kendrick Lamar",t:"To Pimp a Butterfly",y:2015,g:"Hip Hop",d:"Lamar spent over two years crafting this album, recording in studios across the US and South Africa, enlisting jazz musicians Thundercat, Kamasi Washington, Terrace Martin, and Robert Glasper. The album weaves a continuous spoken-word poem through its tracks — fully revealed only on the final song as an imagined conversation with Tupac Shakur. Released during the height of the Black Lives Matter movement, 'Alright' became an unofficial protest anthem. It won five Grammy Awards and was later cited by the Pulitzer Prize committee when Lamar became the first non-classical, non-jazz artist to win the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2018 for his follow-up DAMN. The album debuted at number one, selling 324,000 copies in its first week.",tr:["Wesley's Theory","For Free?","King Kunta","Institutionalized","These Walls","u","Alright","For Sale?","Momma","Hood Politics","How Much a Dollar Cost","Complexion","The Blacker the Berry","You Ain't Gotta Lie","i","Mortal Man"],s:[2,6,10,12]},
{a:"Fleetwood Mac",t:"Rumours",y:1977,g:"Rock",d:"Recorded between February and August 1976 in Sausalito, California while every romantic relationship in the band was simultaneously disintegrating. John and Christine McVie were divorcing, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks had just split, and Mick Fleetwood had discovered his wife's affair with his best friend. The personal turmoil fueled extraordinarily raw songwriting — Christine's 'Don't Stop' was literally addressed to her ex-husband sitting across the studio. Despite (or because of) prodigious cocaine use and emotional chaos, the album yielded four US Top 10 singles. It spent 31 weeks at number one and has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums in history.",tr:["Second Hand News","Dreams","Never Going Back Again","Don't Stop","Go Your Own Way","Songbird","The Chain","You Make Loving Fun","I Don't Want to Know","Oh Daddy","Gold Dust Woman"],s:[1,4,6,10]},
{a:"Lauryn Hill",t:"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill",y:1998,g:"R&B / Hip Hop",d:"After departing the Fugees at the height of their fame, Hill retreated to her home studio in South Orange, New Jersey and Tuff Gong Studios in Jamaica to record this solo debut. She was pregnant with her first child during production, and themes of motherhood, spirituality, and self-discovery permeate the album. The interludes feature recordings of an actual classroom, framing the album as a lesson in love. It debuted at number one with 422,000 first-week sales — at the time the highest for a female artist — and won five Grammy Awards including Album of the Year, making Hill the first woman to win five Grammys in one night. Despite persistent controversies over songwriting credits with collaborating musicians, it remains a landmark that single-handedly defined neo-soul.",tr:["Lost Ones","Ex-Factor","To Zion","Doo Wop (That Thing)","Superstar","Final Hour","When It Hurts So Bad","I Used to Love Him","Forgive Them Father","Every Ghetto Every City","Nothing Even Matters","Everything Is Everything"],s:[1,3,6,11]},
{a:"Nirvana",t:"Nevermind",y:1991,g:"Grunge",d:"Recorded in just six weeks at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California with producer Butch Vig, on a modest budget of $65,000. Geffen Records initially expected the album to sell around 250,000 copies — it sold 30 million. When 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' exploded on MTV, the album knocked Michael Jackson's Dangerous off the number one spot in January 1992, a symbolic moment marking the end of 1980s pop excess and the beginning of alternative rock's mainstream dominance. Kurt Cobain later expressed ambivalence about its polished production, saying he would have preferred a rawer sound closer to the band's punk roots. The underwater baby on the cover, photographed by Kirk Weddle, has become one of the most iconic album images of all time.",tr:["Smells Like Teen Spirit","In Bloom","Come as You Are","Breed","Lithium","Polly","Territorial Pissings","Drain You","Lounge Act","Stay Away","On a Plain","Something in the Way"],s:[0,2,4,7]},
{a:"Marvin Gaye",t:"What's Going On",y:1971,g:"Soul",d:"Inspired by a police brutality incident witnessed by Four Tops member Renaldo Benson and by letters from his brother Frankie serving in Vietnam, Gaye fought bitterly with Berry Gordy and Motown to release this deeply personal concept album. Gordy considered it uncommercial and shelved it for months until Gaye threatened to never record again. When finally released, it became Motown's fastest-selling album to that date. The recording technique was revolutionary — Gaye layered multiple vocal tracks over himself, sang the entire album in sequence as a continuous performance, and incorporated crowd noise and ambient sound. It addressed Vietnam, poverty, drug abuse, and ecology with a tenderness that made its politics impossible to dismiss, transforming what soul music was allowed to say.",tr:["What's Going On","What's Happening Brother","Flyin' High","Save the Children","God Is Love","Mercy Mercy Me","Right On","Wholy Holy","Inner City Blues"],s:[0,5,8]},
{a:"The Beatles",t:"Abbey Road",y:1969,g:"Rock",d:"Though Let It Be was released later, Abbey Road was the last album the Beatles recorded together, made during the summer of 1969 as the band was fracturing irreparably. George Harrison emerged as a songwriting equal with 'Something' and 'Here Comes the Sun,' two of the album's finest tracks. The Side B medley — eight song fragments stitched into a continuous 16-minute suite by producer George Martin — represents the peak of the band's studio craft. The recording featured one of the first uses of the Moog synthesizer on a rock album. Iain Macmillan's crosswalk photograph, taken in ten minutes on August 8, 1969, made the Abbey Road zebra crossing a permanent tourist destination. The album topped charts in both the UK and US and has sold over 31 million copies.",tr:["Come Together","Something","Maxwell's Silver Hammer","Oh!

{a:"Daft Punk",t:"Discovery",y:2001,g:"Electronic",d:"Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo drew from the French disco and funk records they grew up hearing, filtering them through vocoders, talk boxes, and house production to create what Bangalter described as making the music they wished existed. The album was conceived alongside an anime film, Interstella 5555, directed by Leiji Matsumoto, with each track soundtracking a chapter. 'One More Time' was built around a pitched-up sample of Eddie Johns' 'More Spell on You,' while 'Digital Love' samples George Duke's 'I Love You More.' The album sold over 3 million copies worldwide and its influence on pop, indie, and electronic music over the following two decades is almost incalculable — from Kanye West to LCD Soundsystem to The Weeknd.",tr:["One More Time","Aerodynamic","Digital Love","Harder Better Faster Stronger","Crescendolls","Nightvision","Superheroes","High Life","Something About Us","Voyager","Veridis Quo","Face to Face","Too Long"],s:[0,2,3,8]},
{a:"Kanye West",t:"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy",y:2010,g:"Hip Hop",d:"After the infamous Taylor Swift VMA incident in 2009 and subsequent public backlash, West self-exiled to Honolulu and assembled an extraordinary team — Kid Cudi, Nicki Minaj, Bon Iver's Justin Vernon, Rick Ross, Pusha T, Raekwon, RZA, and others rotated through the Hawaii sessions over months. The production is staggeringly dense: 'Power' alone samples 12 different sources including King Crimson and Afromerica. 'Runaway' builds from a single piano note into a nine-minute epic ending in Auto-Tuned distortion meant to represent communication breakdown. George Condo's controversial cover art was banned by several retailers. The album debuted at number one and is now widely considered one of the greatest hip hop albums ever recorded — a maximalist cathedral of sound built from the rubble of public disgrace.",tr:["Dark Fantasy","Gorgeous","POWER","All of the Lights","Monster","So Appalled","Devil in a New Dress","Runaway","Hell of a Life","Blame Game","Lost in the World"],s:[2,3,6,7]},
{a:"David Bowie",t:"Ziggy Stardust",y:1972,g:"Glam Rock",d:"Bowie invented Ziggy Stardust — an androgynous alien rock star who comes to Earth as a messianic figure, becomes corrupted by fame, and is ultimately destroyed by his own band. The character drew from Iggy Pop's raw stage presence, the alien imagery of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the doomed glamour of Vince Taylor, a 1950s rocker who came to believe he was an alien. Recorded at Trident Studios in London with guitarist Mick Ronson, whose arrangements elevated Bowie's folk-influenced compositions into glam rock anthems. Bowie performed as Ziggy for 18 months before famously killing the character on stage at the Hammersmith Odeon in July 1973, announcing 'not only is this the last show of the tour, but it's the last show that we'll ever do' — stunning both band and audience.",tr:["Five Years","Soul Love","Moonage Daydream","Starman","It Ain't Easy","Lady Stardust","Star","Hang On to Yourself","Ziggy Stardust","Suffragette City","Rock 'n' Roll Suicide"],s:[0,2,3,8]},
{a:"Arcade Fire",t:"Funeral",y:2004,g:"Indie Rock",d:"Named for the deaths of several band members' family members during its creation — Win Butler's grandfather, Régine Chassagne's grandmother, and Richard Reed Parry's aunt all passed away. The Montreal collective, sometimes numbering up to 15 musicians on stage with violins, cellos, French horns, and accordion, channeled grief into euphoric, orchestral anthems. Recorded in a Montreal church and a converted loft, it was released on the tiny Merge Records label and became a word-of-mouth phenomenon, with David Bowie, David Byrne, and U2 publicly championing the band. The album's four 'Neighborhood' tracks form a loose narrative about suburban isolation and escape. It revitalized indie rock at a time when the genre had become synonymous with small ambitions, proving sincerity could be revolutionary.",tr:["Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)","Neighborhood #2 (Laika)","Une Annee Sans Lumiere","Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)","Neighborhood #4 (7 Kettles)","Crown of Love","Wake Up","Haiti","Rebellion (Lies)","In the Backseat"],s:[0,3,6,8]},
{a:"Prince",t:"Purple Rain",y:1984,g:"Pop / Rock",d:"Both a soundtrack and a standalone masterpiece, created for the semi-autobiographical film of the same name. Prince recorded most of the album at his home studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota and at First Avenue nightclub in Minneapolis, where several tracks were captured live. He played almost every instrument himself. 'When Doves Cry' was radical for a pop single — Prince removed the bass line entirely, creating an unsettling, skeletal funk track that still topped the charts for five weeks. The album spent 24 consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard 200, sold over 25 million copies, and won both an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and two Grammys. The title track's guitar solo, recorded in a single take, is widely regarded as one of the greatest guitar performances ever captured.",tr:["Let's Go Crazy","Take Me with U","The Beautiful Ones","Computer Blue","Darling Nikki","When Doves Cry","I Would Die 4 U","Baby I'm a Star","Purple Rain"],s:[0,3,5,8]},
{a:"Bjork",t:"Homogenic",y:1997,g:"Art Pop",d:"After the unsettling experience of a disturbed fan mailing her a letter bomb (intercepted by London police in 1996), Bjork retreated to her native Iceland and channeled the volcanic landscape directly into the music. She worked with producers Mark Bell of LFO and Howie B, combining the Icelandic String Octet's lush arrangements with abrasive electronic beats. The cover, shot by Nick Knight, depicts Bjork as a warrior in an Alexander McQueen-designed outfit. The album was recorded partly at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas and mixed in Spain, but its sound is unmistakably Icelandic — glacial, tectonic, alien. 'Joga' uses gabba beats under sweeping strings, while 'Pluto' is pure aggression. It's the album where Bjork's vision crystallized most purely.",tr:["Hunter","Joga","Unravel","Bachelorette","All Neon Like","5 Years","Immature","Alarm Call","Pluto","All Is Full of Love"],s:[0,1,3,9]},
{a:"OutKast",t:"Aquemini",y:1998,g:"Hip Hop",d:"The title merges Aquarius (Andre 3000's sign) and Gemini (Big Boi's), reflecting the duo's increasingly divergent personalities — Andre pushing toward psychedelic experimentation, Big Boi staying rooted in Southern funk. Recorded at several Atlanta studios, it features live instrumentation throughout, with George Clinton appearing on 'Synthesizer.' The album includes the eight-minute 'SpottieOttieDopaliscious,' a spoken-word narrative over a horn sample that became one of hip hop's most revered deep cuts. 'Rosa Parks,' the lead single, used the civil rights icon's name metaphorically, leading to a lawsuit that wasn't settled until 2005. Aquemini proved Atlanta could produce hip hop as artistically ambitious as anything from New York or Los Angeles, and its influence on Southern rap is foundational.",tr:["Return of the G","Rosa Parks","Skew It on the Bar-B","Aquemini","Synthesizer","Slump","West Savannah","Da Art of Storytellin Pt 1","Da Art of Storytellin Pt 2","SpottieOttieDopaliscious","Liberation","Chonkyfire"],s:[1,3,7,9]},
{a:"Joy Division",t:"Unknown Pleasures",y:1979,g:"Post-Punk",d:"Four young men from Salford, recorded in three weeks at Strawberry Studios in Stockport with producer Martin Hannett, whose obsessive production methods — isolating each instrument, adding metallic reverb, recording smashing glass — infuriated the band but created an unnervingly spacious, cavernous sound utterly unlike the punk bands around them. Peter Saville's cover design, depicting radio waves from a pulsar star (taken from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy), became the most reproduced image in music merchandise history. Singer Ian Curtis was suffering from worsening epilepsy and a deteriorating marriage — pain audible in every syllable. The album sold modestly on release but its influence on post-punk, gothic rock, new wave, and alternative music is virtually immeasurable. Curtis died by suicide the following year, aged 23.",tr:["Disorder","Day of the Lords","Candidate","Insight","New Dawn Fades","She's Lost Control","Shadowplay","Wilderness","Interzone","I Remember Nothing"],s:[0,4,5,6]},
{a:"Stevie Wonder",t:"Songs in the Key of Life",y:1976,g:"Soul / Funk",d:"A sprawling double album with a bonus four-track EP, recorded over two years at studios in Los Angeles, New York, and Wonder's own facility. Over 130 musicians contributed, including Herbie Hancock, George Benson, and Minnie Riperton. It entered the Billboard chart at number one — only the third album in history to do so — and stayed there for 13 non-consecutive weeks. 'Isn't She Lovely' was written for Wonder's newborn daughter Aisha, and features her actual infant sounds on the recording. 'Pastime Paradise' was later sampled by Coolio for 'Gangsta's Paradise.' The album represented the culmination of Wonder's extraordinary creative run of the 1970s, during which he renegotiated his Motown contract at 21 to gain full artistic control — something virtually unheard of at the label. It won Album of the Year at the Grammys.",tr:["Love's in Need of Love Today","Village Ghetto Land","Sir Duke","I Wish","Knocks Me Off My Feet","Pastime Paradise","Isn't She Lovely","Joy Inside My Tears","Black Man","If It's Magic","As","Another Star"],s:[2,3,6,10]},
{a:"Portishead",t:"Dummy",y:1994,g:"Trip Hop",d:"Beth Gibbons, Geoff Barrow, and Adrian Utley essentially created the trip hop genre with this debut, though the band always resented the label. Barrow, a former tape operator at Coach House Studios in Bristol, constructed beats from scratched vinyl, sampled spy-film soundtracks (particularly from Lalo Schifrin's Mission: Impossible), and layered Utley's jazz guitar beneath Gibbons' devastating vocal performances. The album was recorded on a minimal budget at Bristol's Coach House and State of Art studios. 'Sour Times' samples Lalo Schifrin's 'Danube Incident,' while 'Glory Box' is built on an Isaac Hayes sample. It won the Mercury Music Prize in 1995 and has sold over 3 million copies. Its smoky, cinematic noir atmosphere spawned a thousand imitators but has never been matched — it still sounds like 3 AM in a city you've never visited.",tr:["Mysterons","Sour Times","Strangers","It Could Be Sweet","Wandering Star","It's a Fire","Numb","Roads","Pedestal","Biscuit","Glory Box"],s:[1,4,7,10]},
{a:"Frank Ocean",t:"Blonde",y:2016,g:"R&B",d:"After the commercial breakthrough of Channel Orange, Ocean disappeared for four years, emerging with a complex visual album called Endless to fulfill his Def Jam contract, then independently releasing Blonde the very next day — one of the most audacious moves in music business history. The album was recorded across studios in London, New York, Los Angeles, and Boca Raton with contributions from Pharrell, Jon Brion, James Blake, Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood, and The Beatles' 'Here, There and Everywhere' reinterpreted on 'White Ferrari.' Ocean deliberately stripped away conventional pop production — songs drift, morph, and dissolve. The beat switch midway through 'Nights' became one of the most analyzed moments in modern music. Despite zero singles, no radio play, and no tour, it debuted at number one and is now widely considered the defining R&B album of the 2010s.",tr:["Nikes","Ivy","Pink + White","Solo","Skyline To","Self Control","Nights","Solo (Reprise)","Pretty Sweet","White Ferrari","Seigfried","Godspeed","Futura Free"],s:[1,2,5,6]},
{a:"Nas",t:"Illmatic",y:1994,g:"Hip Hop",d:"Nasir Jones was 20 years old and living in the Queensbridge housing projects — the largest public housing development in North America — when he recorded this debut. Production was split between DJ Premier, Pete Rock, Q-Tip, Large Professor, and L.E.S., each contributing beats that drew from jazz, soul, and the raw sound of New York streets. The album was recorded at Chung King Studios, Battery Studios, and D&D Studios across 1993-94. At just 39 minutes and 10 tracks, every verse is packed with vivid, cinematic storytelling about life in Queensbridge. 'N.Y. State of Mind' was recorded in one take — Nas freestyled the lyrics while hearing the beat for the first time. It sold modestly on release compared to its peers but is now universally cited as one of the greatest hip hop albums ever made, a standard of lyrical density that remains unmatched.",tr:["The Genesis","N.Y.

He wrote the songs in his home studio while watching rain fall, consuming copious amounts of hallucinogens, and confronting his fear of aging. The sessions at Hook End Manor and RAK Studios were fraught — keyboardist Lol Tolhurst was fired during recording for alcohol problems, and Fiction Records head Chris Parry initially rejected the album as 'too slow and too long.' At 72 minutes and 12 tracks, it is indeed vast — but every moment is suffused with a lush, layered beauty that made it their most commercially successful record, reaching number three in the US and spawning the singles 'Lovesong,' 'Lullaby,' and 'Pictures of You.' 'Lovesong' was written as a wedding present for Smith's wife Mary, with whom he had been together since childhood.",tr:["Plainsong","Pictures of You","Closedown","Lovesong","Last Dance","Lullaby","Fascination Street","Prayers for Rain","The Same Deep Water as You","Disintegration"],s:[0,1,3,5]},

Mitchell was 27, navigating the end of her relationship with Graham Nash, the beginning of her affair with James Taylor, and the private grief of having placed a daughter for adoption years earlier (addressed in 'Little Green,' though its subject remained secret for decades). Engineer Henry Lewy said she was 'about as open as a human being can be' during these sessions. The recording is extraordinarily intimate — you can hear her fingers on the strings, her breath between phrases. Kris Kristofferson attended a playback session and said 'Save something for yourself, Joni.'

He assembled nine MCs from the slums of Staten Island — each with a radically distinct style and alias — and produced the entire album from a basement studio using cheap equipment, kung-fu movie samples, and soul records played on a dusty turntable. The lo-fi aesthetic wasn't a choice but a necessity: RZA couldn't afford better gear. But the gritty sound became the group's signature. Each MC — GZA, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck, U-God, Masta Killa — brought a different energy, from cerebral to chaotic. RZA's master plan included a clause allowing each member to sign individual solo deals with different labels, turning Wu-Tang into a hip hop corporation. The album has sold over 2 million copies and its approach — the collective model, the martial arts mythology, the lo-fi grime — became a permanently imprinted template.",tr:["Bring da Ruckus","Shame on a Nigga","Clan in da Front","Wu-Tang 7th Chamber","Can It Be All So Simple","Da Mystery of Chessboxin","Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta F Wit","C.R.E.A.M.","Method Man","Protect Ya Neck","Tearz"],s:[0,5,7,8]},

The album is split into two halves: Side A ('Hounds of Love') contains five standalone pop singles of extraordinary quality, while Side B ('The Ninth Wave') is a conceptual suite about a woman adrift at sea at night, drifting between consciousness and dream. 'Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)' was Bush's biggest hit, originally titled just 'A Deal with God' until EMI feared religious controversy. Nearly four decades later, the song reached number one in multiple countries after its use in Stranger Things Season 4 in 2022, introducing Bush to an entirely new generation.",tr:["Running Up That Hill","Hounds of Love","The Big Sky","Mother Stands for Comfort","Cloudbusting","And Dream of Sheep","Under Ice","Waking the Witch","Watching You Without Me","Jig of Life","Hello Earth","The Morning Fog"],s:[0,1,4,11]},

Madlib drew from an impossibly deep crate of obscure jazz, library music, cartoon soundtracks, and psychedelic soul to create beat collages that shift every few bars. Most of the 22 tracks are under two minutes, giving the album a dizzying, channel-surfing quality. DOOM's lyrics are labyrinthine — dense with internal rhymes, oblique references, and wordplay that reveals new meanings on every listen.

The shift alienated some early fans but won millions of new ones — 'Let It Happen' was a seven-minute opus that took over a year to finish, its middle section built around a deliberately stuck-CD glitch effect. Parker, a self-described perfectionist, mixed 'Let It Happen' over 100 times.

The four-part suite — Acknowledgement, Resolution, Pursuance, Psalm — is a spiritual devotional documenting Coltrane's gratitude for overcoming heroin and alcohol addiction through a religious awakening in 1957. During 'Acknowledgement,' Coltrane chants the album's title as a mantra, gradually transposing it through all 12 keys — symbolically finding the divine in every musical possibility. The liner notes include a poem/prayer written by Coltrane. Originally intended only for the studio, the quartet performed the suite live exactly once, in July 1965 in Antibes, France — a recording that wasn't released until 2002.

Every track was designed as a potential single: of the nine songs, seven were released as singles and all reached the Top 10. Eddie Van Halen contributed the guitar solo on 'Beat It' as a favor, receiving no payment. Vincent Price's horror monologue on 'Thriller' was recorded in two takes. John Landis directed the groundbreaking 14-minute 'Thriller' music video, which cost $500,000 — then the most expensive ever — and is preserved in the Library of Congress.

Filmed across multiple locations including New Orleans parking garages, antebellum plantations, and a flooded living room, it centers Black Southern womanhood with references to Malcolm X, the Mothers of the Movement, and Yoruba mythology.

SZA has said she wrote many songs in 15 minutes or less, channeling raw, unfiltered emotions — jealousy ('The Weekend'), insecurity ('Drew Barrymore'), the ache of growing up ('20 Something'). The honesty resonated massively: Ctrl debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and has since been certified three times platinum, with 'Love Galore' and 'The Weekend' becoming defining tracks of late 2010s R&B.

Pharrell Williams and Kanye West contributed, along with Solange, Playboi Carti, and Lil Uzi Vert, though many features are so heavily processed they're barely recognizable. 'NEW MAGIC WAND' was inspired by Gwen Stefani-era No Doubt.

Released during the first week of COVID-19 lockdowns, it received the first perfect 10.0 score from Pitchfork in a decade. Apple, who had been largely reclusive since the difficult release of The Idler Wheel in 2012, described the album as being about 'getting out of your own head.'

'Cranes in the Sky,' which Solange began writing in 2008, took eight years and multiple producers to complete — she described trying to 'fold sadness into everything I was doing.' The album deliberately avoids the maximalism of mainstream pop R&B, opting for meditative, space-filled production from Raphael Saadiq and others.

Band members have described the recording process as painful — guitarist Ed O'Brien's diary from the sessions reveals months of frustration and uncertainty. Yorke took inspiration from Charles Mingus, Aphex Twin, and talking-points-style lyrics cut up and pulled from a hat.

Guthrie's guitar, processed through layers of effects, creates a shimmering wall of sound that influenced shoegaze, dream pop, and ambient music for decades to come. Fraser was pregnant with Guthrie's child during recording, and the album carries a warmth absent from their earlier, more austere work. 'Cherry-Coloured Funk,' 'Iceblink Luck,' and the title track are among the most transcendently beautiful recordings of the late 20th century.

Johnny Marr's guitar work reached its apex here, layering jangly Rickenbacker, rockabilly riffs, and feedback into arrangements of extraordinary sophistication. Morrissey's lyrics are simultaneously hilarious and devastating: 'Frankly, Mr. Shankly' is addressed to Rough Trade founder Geoff Travis, while 'There Is a Light That Never Goes Out' — voted the greatest song of all time in multiple NME polls — pairs a lover's death wish with one of pop music's most uplifting melodies.

The album sold fewer than 5,000 copies on release. Drake died two years later from an overdose of antidepressants, aged 26. Decades later, a 1999 Volkswagen commercial featuring 'Pink Moon' sparked a massive reassessment, and the album is now considered one of the most hauntingly beautiful acoustic recordings ever made.

Wayne Shorter's tenor saxophone on 'Aja' was recorded in a single take, blowing Fagen's mind.

The ten-minute title track builds through three ascending movements, each solo section more ecstatic than the last, creating an architecture of tension and release that transcended punk's three-chord dogma while sharing its urgency. Fred Smith's bass and Billy Ficca's drums provide a locked-in foundation for the guitars to soar. The album was a commercial failure in America but hit number 28 in the UK.

The album was recorded at Battery Studios in New York and produced primarily by Q-Tip. 'Check the Rhime' and 'Scenario' (featuring Leaders of the New School and a young Busta Rhymes) became anthems.

The music, recorded with his 70-piece band Africa 70, layers interlocking rhythms, jazz horn sections, and Fela's Pidgin English vocals into hypnotic, politically incendiary grooves. The response from the Nigerian government was devastating: on February 18, 1977, 1,000 soldiers attacked Fela's Kalakuta Republic commune, beating residents, assaulting women, and throwing Fela's 78-year-old mother Funmilayo from a second-floor window — injuries from which she died the following year.

This self-titled album, released on Columbia Records after conductor Artur Rodzinski recognized his genius, collected orchestral rounds, canons, and percussion pieces of startling sophistication. Charlie Parker used to sit on the sidewalk beside Moondog and jam. Janis Joplin invited him onstage. He eventually moved to Germany in 1974, where he was recognized as a serious composer and lived until his death in 1999 at age 83.",tr:["Theme","Minisym","Stamping Ground","Birds","Lament I Bird's Lament","Death","Pigmy Pig","Organ Round","Wind River Lullaby"],s:[2,4,7]},
{a:"Xiu Xiu",t:"Fabulous Muscles",y:2004,g:"Experimental / Noise Pop",d:"Jamie Stewart formed Xiu Xiu in San Jose, California after his father's suicide, and the band's music channels extreme emotional states through deliberately abrasive production — drum machines, gamelan percussion, distortion, and Stewart's raw, sometimes screaming vocals. Fabulous Muscles is their most intense and most accessible album simultaneously. 'I Luv the Valley OH!' manages to be a genuinely cathartic pop song built from noise elements, while 'Crank Heart' opens the album with a devastating confession over a simple keyboard melody. Stewart's lyrics confront abuse, sexuality, disability, and suicidal ideation with unflinching directness. The cover of Tracy Chapman's 'Fast Car' strips the original to a whispered plea. Released on 5 Rue Christine records, the album was critically acclaimed but commercially marginal — it's too honest for most listeners, which is precisely what makes it irreplaceable for those who need it.",tr:["Crank Heart","I Luv the Valley OH!","Little Panda McElroy","Fabulous Muscles","Bunny Gamer","Clowne Towne","Support Our Troops OH!","Brian the Vampire","Mike","Nieces Pieces","Fast Car"],s:[0,1,3,10]},
{a:"The Clientele",t:"Strange Geometry",y:2005,g:"Chamber Pop / Indie",d:"Alasdair MacLean's South London trio make music that sounds like autumn sunlight filtering through dusty glass — reverb-drenched guitars, MacLean's gentle English voice, and lyrics obsessed with memory, suburban landscapes, and the passage of time. Strange Geometry, their second album on Merge Records, refines their aesthetic to a near-perfect balance of melancholy and warmth. 'Since K Got Over Me' opens with one of indie pop's most beautiful guitar phrases. The influence of French Impressionist painting and English Romantic poetry runs through every song. The Clientele were never fashionable — they existed entirely outside trends, making music that felt unfashionable by design, which is exactly what gives it its timeless quality. MacLean has cited the Velvet Underground, Galaxie 500, and the films of Eric Rohmer as equal influences. Rarely has a band this talented been this consistently underrated.",tr:["Since K Got Over Me","Make You Mine","Losing Haringey","Step into the Light","K","Geometry","My Own Face Inside the Trees","Everything You See Tonight","Harvest Time","Strange Geometry"],s:[0,2,6,9]},
{a:"Juana Molina",t:"Segundo",y:2000,g:"Folktronica",d:"Before Segundo, Juana Molina was the most famous comedian in Argentina — her sketch show Juana y sus Hermanas was a national phenomenon. She walked away from it all at the height of her fame to make experimental folk music built from loop pedals, acoustic guitar, and her own voice layered dozens of times. Argentine audiences were baffled. Segundo, her second album, was recorded largely at home and released on an independent label. It anticipates the entire folktronica genre — Four Tet, Caribou, and others were doing similar things around the same time, but none with Molina's particular hypnotic intensity. Her voice braids into itself through delay pedals, creating rhythmic patterns from phonemes rather than words. David Byrne championed the album, inviting her to tour and releasing her subsequent records on his Luaka Bop label. Segundo remains a quiet masterpiece of invention — proof that artistic reinvention is possible at any stage.",tr:["El Desconfiado","Mantra del Bicho Feo","El Perro","Tres Almas","Rey de Copas","Guemes","No Llama","Quien?"],s:[0,2,3]},
{a:"Prefab Sprout",t:"Steve McQueen",y:1985,g:"Sophisti-Pop",d:"Paddy McAloon, a Catholic songwriter from County Durham in northeast England, possessed a melodic gift that Thomas Dolby (who produced this album) compared to Brian Wilson and Burt Bacharach. Steve McQueen (renamed Two Wheels Good in the US due to the McQueen estate's objections) features intricate, jazz-inflected pop songs with lyrics of startling literacy — 'Faron Young' is named after the country singer but is actually about desire and theology. Dolby's lush production frames McAloon's songs in shimmering synths and tasteful arrangements. The album was a Top 20 UK hit and should have made Prefab Sprout superstars, but McAloon's complete disinterest in self-promotion and the band's anti-image meant they remained a critical favorite without mass commercial success. McAloon later suffered from severe eye problems and tinnitus that limited his output. Steve McQueen is the finest sophisti-pop album ever recorded — enormous in the UK, unknown in America, permanently overdue for rediscovery.",tr:["Faron Young","Bonny","Appetite","When Love Breaks Down","Goodbye Lucille #1","Hallelujah","Moving the River","Horsin' Around","Desire As","When the Angels"],s:[0,3,5]},
{a:"Pharoah Sanders",t:"Karma",y:1969,g:"Spiritual Jazz",d:"The 33-minute 'The Creator Has a Master Plan' that fills Side A is one of the most ecstatic recordings in the history of music. Sanders, a protege of John Coltrane who pushed the master's spiritual jazz explorations even further into free territory, leads a large ensemble including Leon Thomas, whose extraordinary yodeling vocal technique (adapted from pygmy singing) adds an otherworldly element. The piece builds from a gentle theme through extended group improvisation that reaches almost unbearable intensity before resolving back to peace. Sanders' saxophone playing alternates between tender ballad phrasing and overblown multiphonic shrieks that seem to channel something beyond music. Side B's 'Colors' provides a gentler counterpoint. Released on Impulse! Records, the album represents the peak of the spiritual jazz movement that sought to use music as a vehicle for transcendence and cosmic consciousness.",tr:["The Creator Has a Master Plan","Colors"],s:[0]},
{a:"Ween",t:"The Mollusk",y:1997,g:"Experimental Rock",d:"Dean and Gene Ween (Aaron Freeman and Mickey Melchiondo) built a home studio in Gene's apartment in New Hope, Pennsylvania and created their most cohesive album — a nautical concept record that is simultaneously a pirate shanty collection, a prog-rock epic, an Ennio Morricone tribute, and a collection of perfect pop songs. 'Ocean Man' later became a SpongeBob SquarePants meme, which both delighted and frustrated the band. 'Buckingham Green' is a seven-minute orchestral prog piece with no irony whatsoever. 'Mutilated Lips' buries a gorgeous melody under deliberately alien vocal processing. The album demonstrates Ween's unique position in music — they're frequently dismissed as a joke band, but The Mollusk reveals songwriting craft and genre mastery that most 'serious' artists never achieve. It's funny and sincere, technically impressive and deliberately weird, and rewards repeated listening like few albums from any genre.",tr:["I'm Dancing in the Show Tonight","The Mollusk","Polka Dot Tail","Mutilated Lips","The Blarney Stone","It's Gonna Be Alright","The Golden Eel","Buckingham Green","Ocean Man","She Wanted to Leave"],s:[1,3,7,8]},

Deceit addresses nuclear paranoia, media manipulation, and societal decay with an urgency born from genuine Cold War terror — the album was made as Thatcher's Britain and Reagan's America escalated nuclear tensions. 'S.P.Q.R.' uses marching rhythms and chanted vocals to draw parallels between ancient Rome and modern imperialism. 'Cenotaph' is named for the war memorial in Whitehall. The production techniques — tape manipulation, sampling, industrial percussion — predicted industrial music, noise rock, and post-rock by a decade. Williams died in 2001, aged 43.

This album takes Roots Radics riddims — originally recorded as straightforward reggae tracks — and strips them to skeletal bass and drums, drowning the remains in cavernous echo, reverb, and delay. Each track is themed after a horror movie trope (vampires, zombies, mummies, ghouls), giving the album its irresistible title. But the real horror is how deep the bass goes and how much space Scientist creates by removing rather than adding. It's the definitive dub album — a masterclass in negative space, proving that what you take away can be more powerful than what you put in.",tr:["Vampire","Plague of Zombies","The Mummy's Shroud","Your Teeth in My Neck","The Voodoo Curse","The Ghoul","Dance of the Vampires","Dracula","Night of the Living Dead","The Corpse Rises"],s:[0,3,6,9]},

Using a single microphone and a 4-track tape machine, they captured these songs over several weeks as spring turned to summer, with birdsong, rain, and insects bleeding naturally into the recordings. Lenker's fingerpicked guitar and intimate whisper-singing create the sensation of someone sitting beside you, confiding secrets. The songs deal with heartbreak (reportedly the end of her relationship with Big Thief bandmate Buck Meek), childhood memories, and the overwhelming presence of nature. At 36 minutes, it's devastatingly compact — nothing is wasted, nothing is performed. It's simply the most intimate album of the decade, and possibly the most honest recording made during the pandemic's first year.",tr:["two reverse","ingydar","anything","forwards beckon rebound","heavy focus","half return","come","zombie girl","not a lot just forever","dragon eyes","my angel"],s:[1,2,4,10]},

Working with engineer Gene Estribou, she pioneered a technique of multi-tracked vocal phasing — layering her voice in overlapping harmonics that create a shimmering, psychedelic effect unlike anything else in folk music. The title track 'Parallelograms' uses this technique to extraordinary effect, the voices seeming to bend time and space. Kapp Records released the album to almost no promotion and negligible sales. Perhacs returned to dental hygiene and didn't make another album for 44 years. When internet music communities discovered the album in the early 2000s, original pressings were selling for over $2,000, and it was widely hailed as a lost psychedelic masterpiece. She finally released a second album, The Soul of All Natural Things, in 2014 at age 71.",tr:["Chimacum Rain","Paper Mountain","Dolphin","Parallelograms","Sandy Toes","Hey Who Really Cares?","Moons and Cattails","Morning Colors","If You Were My Man"],s:[2,3,5]},

Recorded at Sweet Tea Recording in Oxford, Mississippi and Chase Park Transduction in Athens, Georgia, it balances noise and melody with extraordinary finesse. 'Helicopter' builds from a whispered vocal into a soaring ambient rock anthem, while 'Desire Lines' features a six-minute guitar solo that dissolves into pure texture. Guitarist Lockett Pundt contributes the devastating 'Sailing,' singing about memory as a boat drifting away. The album's title comes from the concept of a 'halcyon digest' — a summary of the happiest times — and every track feels like it's trying to preserve a fading memory before it disappears completely. Pitchfork named it the 13th best album of the 2010s decade.",tr:["Earthquake","Don't Cry","Revival","Sailing","Memory Boy","Desire Lines","Basement Scene","Helicopter","Fountain Stairs","Coronado","He Would Have Laughed"],s:[1,2,5,7]},
{a:"Cleaners from Venus",t:"Midnight Cleaners",y:1982,g:"Lo-Fi Pop",d:"Martin Newell, a gardener and poet from Wivenhoe, Essex, recorded this album on a 4-track cassette recorder in his bedroom and distributed it by mail order. With no label, no distributor, no press, and no hope of commercial success, Newell created jangle-pop of astonishing quality — melodic invention rivaling The Smiths (who wouldn't debut until the following year) wrapped in charming lo-fi production. Cleaners from Venus released over a dozen cassette-only albums through the 1980s before Newell disbanded the project. He went on to collaborate with XTC's Andy Partridge on The Greatest Living Englishman solo album. In 2010, the Captured Tracks label began reissuing the Cleaners catalog, and Midnight Cleaners was finally recognized as the hidden masterpiece it always was. It's the ultimate lo-fi bedroom pop artifact — proof that great songs need nothing more than talent and a cheap tape recorder.",tr:["Corridor of Dreams","Only a Shadow","Wivenhoe Bells","Songs for a Fading Star","Night Starvation","Drowning Butterflies","Girl on a Swing","Mercury Girl","Midnight Cleaners","Living with Victoria Grey"],s:[0,2,5,7]},

Part free jazz, part existentialist spoken word, part absurdist cabaret, it combines Fontaine's theatrical French vocal delivery with the Art Ensemble's radical improvisation. The title track is built on a simple descending bass line over which Fontaine narrates and the Ensemble erupts. It's funny, frightening, beautiful, and completely insane by turns. The album was released on the Saravah label and was too experimental for French pop audiences and too pop-structured for free jazz listeners. It fell between every possible crack. Decades later, it's been rediscovered as a one-of-a-kind masterpiece — there is literally nothing else that sounds like it in the entire history of recorded music.",tr:["Comme a la Radio","Tanka I","L'Ete l'Ete","Tanka II","Blanche-Neige","Il Pleut","Le Brouillard","C'est Normal"],s:[0,2,4]},

Sun Masks, released on the small Greek label Lyra, combined minimal synthesizers, drum machines, and her ethereal voice in a style that anticipated darkwave and minimal synth by years. In Greece, she was known primarily as a classical pianist and jazz musician; this electronic work was considered an eccentricity. The album was virtually unknown outside Greece until the 2010s reissue wave, when labels like Dark Entries and Minimal Wave began rescuing forgotten electronic gems. Sun Masks was revealed as a pioneering work of European electronic music, and Platonos (born 1951) was rightly recognized as one of the earliest women working in synthesizer-based composition. She has since been sampled by contemporary producers and played major European festivals.",tr:["Shadows' Dance","Sorcerer","Sun Masks","Bloody","Red Alert","Cats in the Dark","Witches","Free Fly"],s:[0,2,6]},
