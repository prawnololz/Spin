  { artist:"Pink Floyd", album:"The Dark Side of the Moon", year:1973, genre:"Progressive Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02ea7caaff71dea1051d49b2fe", desc:"One of the best-selling albums in history — 937 weeks on the Billboard 200. Groundbreaking tape loops, synthesizers, and meditations on time, money, and madness defined album-oriented rock forever." },
  { artist:"Radiohead", album:"OK Computer", year:1997, genre:"Alternative Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02c8b444df094279e70d0ed856", desc:"Radiohead's prophetic third album predicted our anxious relationship with technology before smartphones existed. Mixing prog ambition with alt-rock grit, it became a generational touchstone for alienation." },
  { artist:"Miles Davis", album:"Kind of Blue", year:1959, genre:"Jazz", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e024b292b24e8b7389b4b630e4a", desc:"The best-selling jazz album ever wasn't revolutionary because it was complicated — it simplified. Davis stripped jazz to modal scales and let his legendary sextet breathe, creating music that still sounds fresh." },
  { artist:"Kendrick Lamar", album:"To Pimp a Butterfly", year:2015, genre:"Hip Hop", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02cdb645498cd3d8a2db4d05e1", desc:"A sprawling, jazz-infused odyssey through Black American identity arriving at the peak of Black Lives Matter. Funk, spoken word, and raw lyricism woven into a Pulitzer-worthy statement." },
  { artist:"Fleetwood Mac", album:"Rumours", year:1977, genre:"Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02e52a59a28efa4773dd2bfe1b", desc:"Written while every couple in the band was breaking up, the emotional wreckage fueled the most perfect pop-rock ever recorded. Over 40 million copies sold — proof that great art often comes from great pain." },
  { artist:"Lauryn Hill", album:"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill", year:1998, genre:"R&B / Hip Hop", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02227dc04f5e3e588eb7e0b9d3", desc:"Hill fused hip hop, soul, and reggae, rapping and singing with equal virtuosity over neo-soul production ahead of its time. Five Grammys including Album of the Year — the blueprint for conscious R&B." },
  { artist:"Nirvana", album:"Nevermind", year:1991, genre:"Grunge", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e029aee783874f7d7e14514a4ef", desc:"The album that killed hair metal. Cobain's tortured melodies married to punk fury knocked Michael Jackson off the charts and ushered in an entirely new era of rock music." },
  { artist:"Marvin Gaye", album:"What's Going On", year:1971, genre:"Soul", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e0251630f976a533408890a96e2", desc:"Gaye fought Motown to release this politically charged concept album about Vietnam, poverty, and ecology. Lush orchestration and aching falsetto turned protest into poetry, changing what soul music could say." },
  { artist:"The Beatles", album:"Abbey Road", year:1969, genre:"Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02dc30583ba717007b00cceb25", desc:"Their final recorded album is their most sonically accomplished. The Side B medley — song fragments stitched into a breathtaking suite — is arguably the greatest 16 minutes in rock history." },
  { artist:"Daft Punk", album:"Discovery", year:2001, genre:"Electronic", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e022c0252c4e4a988e7e6490583", desc:"The French duo filtered disco, funk, and house through vocoders to create an electronic pop masterpiece. From the euphoric 'One More Time' to the bittersweet 'Something About Us' — each track a complete world." },
  { artist:"Kanye West", album:"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy", year:2010, genre:"Hip Hop", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e022188f587a8f4e32a3acf54df", desc:"Born from exile after the Taylor Swift incident, Kanye retreated to Hawaii and assembled a murderers' row to craft hip hop's maximalist opus. Every track a cathedral of sound — baroque, ambitious, genius." },
  { artist:"David Bowie", album:"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust", year:1972, genre:"Glam Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e020ca902bca6d3e3216928baf7", desc:"Bowie invented an alien rock messiah, told his story across 11 tracks, then murdered the character on stage. Glam, sci-fi, and existential dread wrapped in some of the catchiest guitar rock of the 1970s." },
  { artist:"Arcade Fire", album:"Funeral", year:2004, genre:"Indie Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02ae85a18a1acdc23a1b5b0e44", desc:"Named after several deaths in the band members' families, this debut turned grief into anthemic catharsis. A Montreal orchestra-sized indie band proved maximalism and sincerity could coexist." },
  { artist:"Prince", album:"Purple Rain", year:1984, genre:"Pop / Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e0240db29e94c4b49e4a7f80e4b", desc:"Half soundtrack, half concept album, all genius. Prince fused funk, rock, pop, and new wave into a singular vision. The title track's six-minute guitar solo is one of the greatest performances in popular music." },
  { artist:"Björk", album:"Homogenic", year:1997, genre:"Art Pop", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02463de760c4dbb44b2a1f5c09", desc:"Björk merged volcanic Icelandic landscapes with orchestral strings and cutting-edge beats — both ancient and futuristic. Electronic music with a beating heart, like watching tectonic plates shift in real time." },
  { artist:"OutKast", album:"Aquemini", year:1998, genre:"Hip Hop", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02ce30cce498a77f4c20b7f498", desc:"André 3000 and Big Boi pushed Southern hip hop into uncharted territory — psychedelic funk, spoken word, live instrumentation, and some of the most inventive flows ever recorded. ATL proved it could out-groove both coasts." },
  { artist:"Joy Division", album:"Unknown Pleasures", year:1979, genre:"Post-Punk", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02a0c48bf9b8fbe4b4e7a4c29f", desc:"Peter Saville's iconic pulsar cover became the most screen-printed image in music. Martin Hannett's cavernous production turned four young men from Manchester into the sound of urban alienation itself." },
  { artist:"Stevie Wonder", album:"Songs in the Key of Life", year:1976, genre:"Soul / Funk", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02a4c29bbc0ededcccae981037", desc:"A double album so ambitious it needed a bonus EP. Wonder synthesized jazz, funk, soul, pop, and African music into a 21-track statement of radical joy and political consciousness." },
  { artist:"Portishead", album:"Dummy", year:1994, genre:"Trip Hop", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02faa89e80ef469a8a8e515ee9", desc:"Beth Gibbons' spectral voice over noir-film samples and scratchy beats essentially invented trip hop. The sound of 3 AM — smoky, paranoid, impossibly cool. The album that launched a thousand dimly lit cocktail bars." },
  { artist:"Frank Ocean", album:"Blonde", year:2016, genre:"R&B", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02c5649add07ed3720be9d5526", desc:"Ocean dismantled R&B and rebuilt it as impressionist poetry. Deliberately anti-commercial, full of space and negative sound — an album about memory and longing. The 'Nights' beat switch is one of the most celebrated moments in modern music." },
  { artist:"The Velvet Underground", album:"The Velvet Underground & Nico", year:1967, genre:"Art Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e0241aa6776dc15fdd80505044e", desc:"Brian Eno said everyone who bought this album started a band. Warhol-produced and ignored on release, its drone rock and Lou Reed's deadpan tales became the DNA of punk, indie, and alternative music." },
  { artist:"Talking Heads", album:"Remain in Light", year:1980, genre:"New Wave", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e0238194b0a407ec39e2a142680", desc:"David Byrne and Brian Eno merged Fela Kuti's Afrobeat with NYC art-punk, creating polyrhythmic grooves decades ahead of their time. 'Once in a Lifetime' — an existential crisis set to a bassline." },
  { artist:"D'Angelo", album:"Voodoo", year:2000, genre:"Neo Soul", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02f5b8b0d1736d4497d7ee7593", desc:"D'Angelo spent years with Questlove creating the most organic-sounding R&B album of the digital age. Every instrument slightly behind the beat, creating a languid, funky pocket that redefined neo-soul." },
  { artist:"Massive Attack", album:"Mezzanine", year:1998, genre:"Trip Hop", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e027ce6d77b2ee0eb7b76cd34ca", desc:"Trip hop's darkest masterpiece. 'Teardrop' barely scratches the surface of this pitch-black, bass-heavy odyssey. The band nearly imploded making it, and you can hear the tension in every track." },
  { artist:"Nas", album:"Illmatic", year:1994, genre:"Hip Hop", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e020b7e75a1154e0b4dba3a53f6", desc:"A 20-year-old from Queensbridge recorded the most lyrically dense hip hop album ever in ten tracks and 39 minutes. Beats by Premier, Pete Rock, Q-Tip — a standard that still hasn't been surpassed." },
  { artist:"The Cure", album:"Disintegration", year:1989, genre:"Gothic Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02125b1a330b6f6100ab19dbed", desc:"Robert Smith said making this was like drowning, and it sounds like it — vast, layered, suffocatingly beautiful. Their most commercial record is paradoxically their most uncommercial in spirit — 72 minutes of gorgeous gothic despair." },
  { artist:"Joni Mitchell", album:"Blue", year:1971, genre:"Folk", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02a1d0e87846a98e0363a78d4b", desc:"Mitchell stripped everything bare — minimal production, brutally honest lyrics about love and freedom — creating the singer-songwriter album against which all others are measured. Vulnerability as bravery." },
  { artist:"Wu-Tang Clan", album:"Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)", year:1993, genre:"Hip Hop", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02340e4b0a25f5288c83be2a55", desc:"Nine MCs from Staten Island over RZA's grimy, kung-fu-sampling production changed hip hop forever. The lo-fi aesthetic, martial arts mythology, and nine distinct personalities — a blueprint every rap collective has tried to replicate." },
  { artist:"Kate Bush", album:"Hounds of Love", year:1985, genre:"Art Pop", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e028a35ac6752f32df08dfc48f5", desc:"Side A: five perfect pop singles. Side B: a conceptual suite about drowning and transcendence. Bush produced it herself, creating a visionary album that took decades for the mainstream to fully appreciate." },
  { artist:"Madvillain", album:"Madvillainy", year:2004, genre:"Hip Hop", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02a4ed81a43e8e312b4a32477a", desc:"MF DOOM's labyrinthine wordplay over Madlib's beat-collage — jazz loops, cartoon samples, psychedelic fragments. Most tracks under two minutes, every second packed with ideas that reward infinite replays." },
  { artist:"Tame Impala", album:"Currents", year:2015, genre:"Psychedelic Pop", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e029e1cfc756886ac782e363d79", desc:"Kevin Parker reinvented psychedelic rock as shimmering synth-pop. The production is absurdly detailed — every swoosh and phaser precisely placed — becoming a gateway drug for a generation discovering psych music." },
  { artist:"John Coltrane", album:"A Love Supreme", year:1965, genre:"Jazz", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e020ee4cbb3de2e3cabc6957c55", desc:"Coltrane's four-part spiritual devotional — Acknowledgement, Resolution, Pursuance, Psalm — is jazz as prayer. Recorded in one session, channeling recovery from addiction into music of overwhelming transcendence." },
  { artist:"Michael Jackson", album:"Thriller", year:1982, genre:"Pop", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e0204e52a9a44577393b720de1e", desc:"The best-selling album in human history at 70+ million copies. Every track a potential single. Quincy Jones' production was decades ahead, and Jackson's performances redefined what a pop star could be." },
  { artist:"The Notorious B.I.G.", album:"Ready to Die", year:1994, genre:"Hip Hop", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02db29e0b197e31c83c3c92e6c", desc:"Biggie's vivid, cinematic debut — funny, terrifying, deeply human. His flow was so effortlessly musical it could make a grocery list sound like Shakespeare. 'Juicy' remains hip hop's ultimate rags-to-riches anthem." },
  { artist:"Pixies", album:"Doolittle", year:1989, genre:"Alternative Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02a84f3cfcfa9e4bae560b6b8c", desc:"Kurt Cobain admitted Nevermind was basically the Pixies. Loud-quiet-loud, Black Francis' surrealist screaming, and Kim Deal's unforgettable basslines created the template for every 90s alternative band." },
  { artist:"Beyoncé", album:"Lemonade", year:2016, genre:"Pop / R&B", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e020fce46bca4a1141334bfc63c", desc:"A visual album weaving infidelity, Black Southern feminism, and generational trauma into a genre-hopping odyssey from country to punk. Each track a different emotional stage — the album as total artwork." },
  { artist:"Patti Smith", album:"Horses", year:1975, genre:"Punk Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02fa9c04be27826e8f9e671b68", desc:"'Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine' — punk rock's arrival announced two years before the Sex Pistols. Smith fused beat poetry with three-chord energy and Mapplethorpe's iconic cover." },
  { artist:"SZA", album:"Ctrl", year:2017, genre:"R&B", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e024753b6a3bda42d0658ffae37", desc:"SZA turned insecurity, jealousy, and desire into the millennial R&B bible. Refreshingly unpolished and confessional — like reading someone's diary, if that diary had impeccable production." },
  { artist:"Tyler, the Creator", album:"IGOR", year:2019, genre:"Neo Soul / Synth Pop", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02751ee3e68c76e8cbcc1cfcc1", desc:"Tyler abandoned rap for synth-soul about unrequited bisexual love. Pharrell meets Stevie Wonder filtered through uncompromising vision. Won Best Rap Album despite barely having any rapping." },
  { artist:"The Clash", album:"London Calling", year:1979, genre:"Punk Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02b0e5e0c5536b5702b5ef3608", desc:"A double album smuggling reggae, rockabilly, jazz, and ska into punk's fury. Pennie Smith's smashed-bass cover is the most punk image ever taken, and the music proved punk could contain multitudes." },
  { artist:"Fiona Apple", album:"Fetch the Bolt Cutters", year:2020, genre:"Art Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e0298176dc7cc239a3752803c40", desc:"Recorded at home with dogs barking, Apple used stomping, banging, and chanting to create 2020's most acclaimed album. Music as liberation — raw, clattering, and completely unconcerned with commerce." },
  { artist:"Nick Drake", album:"Pink Moon", year:1972, genre:"Folk", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02e00f75d76e15e25a79d78e45", desc:"Drake recorded 28 minutes of acoustic guitar and whispered vocals in two sessions, dropped off the tapes, and disappeared. No overdubs, no fanfare. Decades later, the music's devastating intimacy needed no help." },
  { artist:"Solange", album:"A Seat at the Table", year:2016, genre:"R&B", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e029e2f0bab42e1ffa1e4a56e38", desc:"A meditative, politically charged album about Black womanhood with spoken interludes from her parents. Quiet where most protest albums shout — proof that softness can be the most radical form of resistance." },
  { artist:"Radiohead", album:"Kid A", year:2000, genre:"Experimental Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02b0fe40a6e1692822f5a9d1c1", desc:"After OK Computer, Radiohead destroyed their blueprint. Guitars replaced by glitchy electronics, Yorke's vocals buried in effects. Initially divisive, now considered one of the most important pivots in rock history." },
  { artist:"Stevie Wonder", album:"Innervisions", year:1973, genre:"Soul / Funk", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02adedecc3b757c36e9be1b587", desc:"Three days after release, Wonder nearly died in a car crash. The album he almost didn't survive to promote is a synthesizer-driven marvel — 'Living for the City' packs an entire film's narrative into six minutes." },
  { artist:"The Rolling Stones", album:"Exile on Main St.", year:1972, genre:"Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02e4fe6de5ae3b8263db24c5e5", desc:"Recorded in a sweltering basement in the South of France as tax exiles. Their loosest, rawest, most debated album — now widely regarded as their finest. A bleary-eyed collision of blues, country, gospel, and rock." },
  { artist:"Gorillaz", album:"Demon Days", year:2005, genre:"Alternative / Electronic", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e0239c8ed5a6e755118a1c29384", desc:"Damon Albarn's virtual band went dark, recruiting De La Soul to Dennis Hopper. A dystopian pop opera predicting our screen-addicted future, anchored by 'Feel Good Inc.' and its haunting melodica hook." },
  { artist:"Funkadelic", album:"Maggot Brain", year:1971, genre:"Funk Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e0235eaead0b40bff4a39a7aa4a", desc:"George Clinton told Eddie Hazel to play like his mother just died. The ten-minute solo that opens the album is one of the greatest guitar performances ever — cosmic grief and beauty. The rest weaves funk, psychedelia, and acid rock." },
  { artist:"Herbie Hancock", album:"Head Hunters", year:1973, genre:"Jazz Funk", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02a3ce6e2e9b5b8d1bfc2f43ef", desc:"Hancock took jazz into the funk era and created the first jazz album to go platinum. The clavinet riff of 'Chameleon' is one of the most recognizable hooks in music, and the fusion still sounds futuristic." },
  { artist:"Black Sabbath", album:"Paranoid", year:1970, genre:"Heavy Metal", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02c0e59eab68d4ed8e0e359e6a", desc:"Heavy metal's founding document. Tony Iommi's down-tuned, doom-laden riffs and Ozzy's desperate vocals created a genre from scratch. 'Iron Man,' 'War Pigs' — the bedrock of every heavy music subgenre." },
  { artist:"Steely Dan", album:"Aja", year:1977, genre:"Jazz Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02e1c2a1770a3d83a1e7a87b0a", desc:"Becker and Fagen hired 40+ session musicians for impossible perfection — every chord exotic, every groove immaculate. Steve Gadd's drum solo on the title track is legendary. Audiophiles still use it to test hi-fi systems." },
  { artist:"Brian Eno", album:"Ambient 1: Music for Airports", year:1978, genre:"Ambient", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e0268e38ec4fb46bd0e49b7e2e6", desc:"Eno literally invented ambient music with this album, defining it in the liner notes. Four compositions of looping piano and vocal tapes that created an entirely new way of thinking about what music is for." },
  { artist:"Depeche Mode", album:"Violator", year:1990, genre:"Synth Pop", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02b1f8da7456564e2be8034494", desc:"The synth-pop trio went dark and sensual. 'Personal Jesus' and 'Enjoy the Silence' are among the era's greatest singles, and the album's influence on industrial, electronic, and indie music is immeasurable." },
  { artist:"Sade", album:"Diamond Life", year:1984, genre:"Smooth Jazz / Soul", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02f1e2b11d3fc0abe7b18a4e57", desc:"Sade Adu's impossibly cool contralto over jazz-inflected sophisti-pop created a new category of elegance. 'Smooth Operator' alone would suffice, but the entire album maintains a level of poise most artists never attempt." },
  { artist:"Led Zeppelin", album:"Led Zeppelin IV", year:1971, genre:"Hard Rock", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e021395d4f3de076e32303b5929", desc:"Contains 'Stairway to Heaven,' the most played rock song in radio history. 'When the Levee Breaks' has one of the most sampled drums ever. Zero filler across eight tracks of titanic rock." },
  { artist:"A Tribe Called Quest", album:"The Low End Theory", year:1991, genre:"Hip Hop", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02c1d1e2a3d7a961ecb4e48e71", desc:"The album that married jazz and hip hop for good. Q-Tip and Phife over Ron Carter's upright bass and minimal boom-bap beats — hip hop that's intellectual without sacrificing groove." },
  { artist:"Fela Kuti", album:"Zombie", year:1977, genre:"Afrobeat", cover:"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02dc0fc268c59ef0e46df9a98b", desc:"Two side-long tracks of hypnotic Afrobeat fury aimed at the Nigerian military, who responded by burning Fela's commune. The most dangerous album ever made — every note an act of revolutionary defiance." },
